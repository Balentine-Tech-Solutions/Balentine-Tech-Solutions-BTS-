Demond Balentine Sr.
Aspiring Tech Founder • Technical Co-Founder / Founding Engineer (candidate)

Location: United States • Open to relocate / remote • GitHub: https://github.com/Debalent

Summary
-------
Legacy-driven developer and aspiring tech founder with a product-first mindset and hands-on full-stack experience. I design scalable system architectures and prototype AI tool-chains that increase developer productivity. I lead with a founder mentality—ownership, resourcefulness in ambiguity, and a relentless focus on customer outcomes. Currently developing Balentine Tech Solutions (SaaS platform focused on developing systems and online presence for businesses, supported by multi-tiered studio capabilities for development, recording, and filming to keep projects in-house) and preparing to step into a Technical Co-Founder / Founding Engineer role to help architect platform-level products and engineering culture.

Core Strengths
--------------
- Founder mentality: ownership, resourcefulness, and bias-for-action
- Full-stack architecture & implementation: Next.js, TypeScript, React, Node.js, Postgres
- Mobile: React Native (iOS & Android) exposure and mobile-first thinking
- AI-enabled engineering: tool stacking, RAG, agentic AI patterns, prompt engineering
- Product & customer focus: frequent user feedback loops and production releases
- SaaS & business systems: custom solutions for online presence, operational efficiency, and business growth
- DevOps & deployment: CI/CD, Docker, cloud-hosted production systems (AWS/GCP concepts)
- Data & analytics: forecasting, operational dashboards, instrumentation for real-time visibility
- Leadership: set technical vision, hire and mentor, and establish team culture

Unique Value Proposition (UVP)
------------------------------
**"Complete Digital Transformation Under One Roof"**

BTS addresses the $651B+ SMB digital transformation market by solving a critical pain point: businesses need both technical systems AND professional content, but can't afford enterprise agencies or manage multiple vendors. Our hybrid SaaS + multi-tiered studio model delivers:

- **One-Stop Solution**: Custom software development, professional recording, and video production integrated under one roof
- **Cost-Effective**: Eliminates vendor juggling and reduces costs vs. hiring separate agencies for development, audio, and video
- **Scalable Service Tiers**: From basic SaaS solutions to full-service custom development with multimedia production
- **Local Focus**: Supporting SMBs, creators, and personal brands with comprehensive digital presence solutions

**Target Market**: 71% of small businesses lack professional websites, video content demand up 85% YoY, yet most agencies specialize in only ONE area. BTS fills this gap with integrated technical + creative expertise.

Timeline & Selected Dates
-------------------------
- Balentine Tech Solutions (Founder & Technical Lead) — 2023–Present
- Freelance & Contract Development — 2018–2023

Concrete Tech Experience
------------------------
- Frontend & Platform: Built production Next.js (TypeScript) frontends with SSR/ISR, React component libraries, and responsive UI patterns for B2B dashboards.
- APIs & Services: Designed REST/GraphQL API routes, authentication flows, and integration layers that connect mobile, web, and studio backends.
- Mobile: React Native prototypes for iOS and Android focusing on booking flows, media upload, background sync, and studio resource management.
- Data & Storage: PostgreSQL-backed schemas for transactional workflows, analytics pipelines for forecasting, and event instrumentation for real-time dashboards.
- AI & Automation: Architected RAG-style retrieval + LLM orchestration and agentic workflows to automate multi-step customer tasks and reduce manual operations.
- DevOps: Docker-based builds, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud deployment patterns (AWS/GCP concepts) with monitoring and alerting.

Code Samples & Links
--------------------
See code and runnable demos at: https://github.com/Debalent

Example: Next.js API route (TypeScript) — simple Postgres query using `pg`:

```ts
// pages/api/availability.ts
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'
import { Pool } from 'pg'

const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL })

export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
	const { rows } = await pool.query('SELECT id, start_time, end_time FROM studio_slots WHERE available = true LIMIT 50')
	res.status(200).json({ slots: rows })
}
```

Example: Retrieval + LLM orchestration pattern (pseudo-JS):

```js
// Simplified RAG flow
const docs = await vectorStore.search(query)
const context = docs.map(d => d.text).join('\n')
const prompt = `Use the following context to answer: ${context}\nQuestion: ${query}`
const answer = await llm.call({ prompt })
return answer
```

Project Links & Notes
---------------------
- RelayPoint (prototype): integration of field operations -> scheduling -> analytics (see repo samples in my GitHub)
- Portfolio apps: multiple vertical SaaS demos (B2B booking, subscriptions, studio fulfillment)

How I can tailor this further
----------------------------
- Add specific commit links and file paths from my GitHub to highlight production code examples.
- Produce a 1-page PDF export of this resume and commit it to the repo.
- Draft a 1–2 paragraph cover letter tailored to Bloomlogic and a short email outreach template.

If you'd like, I can (A) add exact repo/file links and sample commits, (B) create the PDF and push it to the repo, or (C) write the Bloomlogic cover letter next.
